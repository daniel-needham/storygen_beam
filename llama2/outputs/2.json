It was one of those days when you feel\nunreasonably depressed, as if something had happened that you couldn\u2019t\nremember. There was no reason for this feeling, though; it seemed to be\nthe result of my having slept badly.\n\nI got out of bed and went over to the window. My room overlooked the\nwork-dormitory. Through the glass I could see the men sitting at their\nmachines. They were all dressed alike in blue coveralls, and they looked\nat me curiously as I passed by them on my way downstairs to the dining\nroom. I didn\u2019t stop to talk to any of them, though, because I didn\u2019t want\nto know what they thought about me.\n\nBreakfast was the same as usual. We sat around a long table eating our\noats and drinking coffee. The conversation was desultory. No one said\nanything interesting or amusing, so we just talked about the weather and\nwhat we would do after dinner.\n\nAfterward I returned to the machine and worked there until six o\u2019clock.\nThen I walked back to my room and took a shower. Afterward I lay down\non the bed and fell into a deep sleep.\n\nWhen I woke up again it was dark outside. I turned on the light and\nlooked around the room. Everything was still and quiet. Then I heard a\nnoise coming from the closet. I opened the door and saw Steve standing\ninside.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe held up a book. \u201cI found this,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt belongs to one of\nthe other miners.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I think it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nHe handed me the book. It was bound in leather, and the pages were\nyellowed with age. As I began to read, I realized that it contained the\nhistory of Mars.\n\nAccording to this history, the first settlers came here more than two\nhundred years ago. They were scientists and engineers who had been sent\nfrom Earth to explore the planet. At first they lived in tents, and they\nhad to grow their own food and make their own tools. But gradually they\nbuilt up a settlement, and then a city, and finally a whole civilization.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about this civilization, however, was its\nmethod of reproduction. Every man and woman was required to have a\ncloning partner\u2014a person with whom they shared everything. When the time\ncame for them to reproduce, they would go into a special chamber together\nand undergo a process called \u201cfusion\u201d which joined their bodies and\nproduced a new being. This being would then be raised as a child, and\nwhen it grew up, it would find itself a new partner and begin the cycle\nall over again.\n\nThis system, according to the historian, had several advantages. For one\nthing, it prevented overpopulation. Since each couple produced only one\nchild every ten years or so, the population remained stable. Moreover, it\nensured that everyone would have a mate, since there were always enough\npeople to go around. And finally, it created a strong bond between couples,\nsince they literally became part of each other.\n\nBut despite these advantages, the system also had some serious drawbacks.\nFor one thing, it meant that people never really knew anyone except\nthemselves and their partners. They might live in the same town all their\nlives, but they would never get to know anyone else very well. And\nperhaps even worse, it meant that children were born without parents.\nThey were simply brought up by whoever happened to be available at the\ntime.\n\nThese things, apparently, led to a great deal of unhappiness among the\nMarsians. According to the historian, there were many suicides, and\nthere were also frequent outbreaks of violence. In fact, there were times\nwhen the entire city would become a battleground, with people fighting\nagainst each other in the streets.\n\nTo put an end to this chaos, the Martian government decided to take\ndrastic action. It began to send out expeditions to explore the surface\nof the planet, looking for new places where people could settle. These\nexpeditions were made up of volunteers, and they were given strict orders\nnot to return unless they found suitable sites.\n\nOne such expedition was led by a man named John Carter. He and his\ncompanions explored the desert regions of Mars, and eventually they\ndiscovered a valley filled with water. Here they built a city, and they\nbegan to live there in peace.\n\nAs I finished reading this account, I felt a strange sensation creeping\nover me. It was as if I had discovered something that I wasn\u2019t supposed\nto know. I looked up at Steve, and I could tell that he was feeling the\nsame way.\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut it means that we\u2019re not alone.

Therefore, I can never truly be considered a real human being.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense! A human being is a human being, regardless of how he came into existence. Everybody deserves respect and consideration, no matter who he is or where he comes from. Do you understand?\u201d\n\nHe nodded slowly. \u201cYes, I understand. But I still cannot leave. I cannot abandon you. I owe you too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen give me your gun.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I need it. I want to take some precautions against any unexpected visitors.\u201d\n\nHe hesitated for a moment, then handed me the weapon without saying anything.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m afraid I must bid you farewell. I have some business to attend to, and I don\u2019t want to keep you waiting any longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoodbye, Steve,\u201d he said softly.\n\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d I replied.\n\nWe embraced each other briefly, then I turned away and walked out of the room. When I reached the door, I looked back and saw him standing there, watching me. For a moment, our eyes met, and I felt a strange sensation in my chest. Then I turned and went out into the night.\n\nWhen I returned to camp, the Martians were still asleep. I approached them cautiously, keeping to the shadows so as not to disturb them. As I drew nearer, I heard one of them stirring in its sleep, and I stopped and waited, listening. I could hear nothing except the sound of its breathing, which seemed to grow louder and slower as it fell deeper into slumber. I took advantage of this opportunity to slip past them and enter the tent.\n\nAs I entered, I noticed that the fire had burned low, and the embers were almost cold. I added some wood to the fire, and soon it was burning brightly again. I sat down beside it, and watched the flames dance and flicker as I pondered my situation.\n\nAt last, I decided that it was time to go to bed. I lay down on my pallet, and closed my eyes. I did not fall asleep immediately, however. Instead, I lay awake for hours, staring up at the ceiling of the tent and thinking about the things that had happened during the day. At last, when the first light of dawn began to filter through the canvas, I knew that I could wait no longer. I opened my eyes, and got up, feeling relieved and grateful that everything was over."}}
