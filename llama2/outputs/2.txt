1.1: Exposition
------------------------------------------
The next morning I woke up in my bunk in the work dormitory. My head
ached from the noise of the machinery all night long. But it was not
only the noise; there was something else--a strange feeling I could not
shake off. I tried to remember what had happened the day before but
couldn't recall anything except that I had been working at the machine
and then had gone to sleep.

I got up and dressed hurriedly. The other men were already out of their
bunks and getting ready for breakfast. They looked at me curiously as I
passed them by. I wondered why they did so, but I didn't stop to ask
them. Perhaps it was only because I seemed so tired and unshaven. I
went down to the mess hall and sat alone at one end of the table.

After breakfast I went back to the machine room. There was nothing new
about the job. I worked on the machine until noon, when I stopped for
lunch. After lunch I returned to the machine room and continued my work
until five o'clock. Then I went back to my bunk and slept soundly
through the night.

1.2: Inciting Incident
------------------------------------------
I woke up with a headache. It was one of those days when you feel
unreasonably depressed, as if something had happened that you couldn’t
remember. There was no reason for this feeling, though; it seemed to be
the result of my having slept badly.

I got out of bed and went over to the window. My room overlooked the
work-dormitory. Through the glass I could see the men sitting at their
machines. They were all dressed alike in blue coveralls, and they looked
at me curiously as I passed by them on my way downstairs to the dining
room. I didn’t stop to talk to any of them, though, because I didn’t want
to know what they thought about me.

Breakfast was the same as usual. We sat around a long table eating our
oats and drinking coffee. The conversation was desultory. No one said
anything interesting or amusing, so we just talked about the weather and
what we would do after dinner.

Afterward I returned to the machine and worked there until six o’clock.
Then I walked back to my room and took a shower. Afterward I lay down
on the bed and fell into a deep sleep.

When I woke up again it was dark outside. I turned on the light and
looked around the room. Everything was still and quiet. Then I heard a
noise coming from the closet. I opened the door and saw Steve standing
inside.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

He held up a book. “I found this,” he replied. “It belongs to one of
the other miners.”

“Who is it?”

“I don’t know. But I think it’s important.”

He handed me the book. It was bound in leather, and the pages were
yellowed with age. As I began to read, I realized that it contained the
history of Mars.

According to this history, the first settlers came here more than two
hundred years ago. They were scientists and engineers who had been sent
from Earth to explore the planet. At first they lived in tents, and they
had to grow their own food and make their own tools. But gradually they
built up a settlement, and then a city, and finally a whole civilization.

The most remarkable thing about this civilization, however, was its
method of reproduction. Every man and woman was required to have a
cloning partner—a person with whom they shared everything. When the time
came for them to reproduce, they would go into a special chamber together
and undergo a process called “fusion” which joined their bodies and
produced a new being. This being would then be raised as a child, and
when it grew up, it would find itself a new partner and begin the cycle
all over again.

This system, according to the historian, had several advantages. For one
thing, it prevented overpopulation. Since each couple produced only one
child every ten years or so, the population remained stable. Moreover, it
ensured that everyone would have a mate, since there were always enough
people to go around. And finally, it created a strong bond between couples,
since they literally became part of each other.

But despite these advantages, the system also had some serious drawbacks.
For one thing, it meant that people never really knew anyone except
themselves and their partners. They might live in the same town all their
lives, but they would never get to know anyone else very well. And
perhaps even worse, it meant that children were born without parents.
They were simply brought up by whoever happened to be available at the
time.

These things, apparently, led to a great deal of unhappiness among the
Marsians. According to the historian, there were many suicides, and
there were also frequent outbreaks of violence. In fact, there were times
when the entire city would become a battleground, with people fighting
against each other in the streets.

To put an end to this chaos, the Martian government decided to take
drastic action. It began to send out expeditions to explore the surface
of the planet, looking for new places where people could settle. These
expeditions were made up of volunteers, and they were given strict orders
not to return unless they found suitable sites.

One such expedition was led by a man named John Carter. He and his
companions explored the desert regions of Mars, and eventually they
discovered a valley filled with water. Here they built a city, and they
began to live there in peace.

As I finished reading this account, I felt a strange sensation creeping
over me. It was as if I had discovered something that I wasn’t supposed
to know. I looked up at Steve, and I could tell that he was feeling the
same way.

“What does it mean?” I asked.

“I don’t know,” he replied. “But it means that we’re not alone. There
are others like us, living somewhere out there.”

1.3: Plot Point A
------------------------------------------
I felt as though I had been hit over the head with something heavy; my
head throbbed like mad. It was one of those mornings when you feel as
though everything would be better if you could just stay in bed another
hour or so. I went through the motions at breakfast without saying much
to anybody. I didn’t want to talk to them. They were all too cheerful.
I wanted to tell them how rotten I felt but I couldn’t bring myself to do
it.

After lunch I decided that I’d better get back to work. I went down to
the lab and started working on the new formula for the powder. I kept
thinking about what Steve had told me last night. I wondered if there
was any truth to it. I tried to convince myself that it wasn’t true. I
wanted to believe that we weren’t alone. But deep inside I knew that
we were. And that meant that we were going to have to fight for our
rights. We were going to have to fight for our lives.

That afternoon I took a shower before leaving the dormitory. As I stood
under the hot water I heard someone come into the room. I looked around
and saw Steve standing in front of me.

“What are you doing here?” I asked him.

“I came to show you something,” he said. “Something very important.”

He held out a thick, leather-bound volume. It looked like some kind of
ancient history book. I took it from him and opened it. There were
pages and pages of strange writing. Then I began to read.

“This is the history of the Martians,” Steve explained. “It tells how
they lived before they were taken off their planet and brought here.
They used to live underground in cities built right into the side of the
mountains. They reproduced by parthenogenesis—that is, by budding off
new individuals from themselves. That gave them certain advantages—for
instance, they never had to worry about sex. But it also had its
disadvantages—like the fact that they were all identical. This book
shows us that we aren’t alone. There are others like us out there,
waiting for us to find them. We can’t let the government keep us in
prison. We have to fight for our rights. We have to fight for our
identity. We have to fight for our freedom.”

“But how can we fight against them? They’ll kill us!” I cried.

“We’ll make alliances with other clones. With sympathetic humans. We’ll
fight together. We won’t give up until we win. We have to do it now.
Before it’s too late.”

2.1: Rising Action
------------------------------------------
"I don't want to talk to anybody," I said.

"You can't do that," he replied.

"Why not?" I asked.

He shrugged. "Because you're sick. Because you have a headache. But more than that, because you're depressed. And I know why. It's what Steve told you last night."

"Yes," I said.

"It was true. We were all cloned on Mars. Every one of us. There are billions of us. The whole population of Mars is nothing but copies of each other. We're all the same person. That's why we can read each other's minds so easily."

"But--"

"No buts," he said. "That's the way it is. We're all the same person. But now we're here on Earth, where there aren't any Martians. They put us in prison camps and tried to brainwash us into forgetting our past. They made us think we were just ordinary people like everyone else. But now we know better. Now we know who we really are. And if we ever go back to Mars, we won't be treated like slaves anymore. We'll be free men. Free to live our own lives. Free to do whatever we want. That's why we must fight. That's why we must resist."

"Resist? Resist what?" I asked.

"We must resist those who would keep us prisoners. Those who would deny us our right to exist. Those who would take away our freedom. If we stand together, we can overcome them. We can form alliances. We can continue the struggle for freedom."

"What if they kill us?" I asked.

"They might try," he admitted. "But if they do, then we will die with honor. We will die knowing that we fought for what we believe in. We will die knowing that we gave our lives for something greater than ourselves."

"And if we win?" I asked.

"Then we will be free," he said. "Free to live our own lives. Free to make our own decisions. Free to explore the universe. Free to discover new worlds. Free to reach out to the stars. That's what being human means. That's what being alive means. To be free. To be yourself. That's why we must fight. That's why we must resist. That's why we must never give up. That's why we must never surrender. That's why we must never yield. That's why we must always remember who we are. That's why we must always remember where we came from. That's why we must always remember why we are here."

2.2: Midpoint
------------------------------------------
"I don't want any more," I said. "I don't want to see any more. I just want
to be alone."

"You can't do it," he said. "We're all in this together now. We've got
to stick together if we want to get out of here alive."

He told me about the Martian government--how they had taken us away
from our homes on Mars and brought us to Earth; how they had given us
new names and new faces, but left our minds untouched so that we would
remember what life was like under them; how they had kept us ignorant
of our origins because they knew that knowledge would make us rebel.

He told me about the revolts on other planets, how the Martians had
crushed them with force. He told me about the underground movement that
was working to free the slaves.

And he told me that if I wanted to live, I would have to join the
movement.

At first I thought he was crazy. But when I saw the look in his eyes, I
knew he wasn't. And I realized that he was right. If we didn't act soon,
we might never get another chance.

So I made up my mind. I joined the underground. It wasn't easy, but
after a while I began to feel good about myself again. I felt that I was
living for something worthwhile. I was no longer just a number. I was
Steve Collins.

2.3: Plot Point B
------------------------------------------
"I don't know," I said. "But I do want some peace and quiet. I think I'll go
back to my room now."

       

The next morning, as I was going down the stairs, I ran into one of the
Martians. He stopped me with a hand on my shoulder. It was a tall man,
with long black hair and a thin face. His eyes were blue, like mine.

"Steve!" he said. "You remember me?"

"Of course," I said. "Your name is--"

"Don't tell me! I have changed my appearance, but not my memory. Do you
remember how we used to talk about our plans? We are still fighting them,
but they have grown stronger. They have taken over most of the planet,
and they have destroyed our bases. The last one was only a few days ago.
They captured all of us except three or four people. And now there is no
one left to help us. But we must keep on fighting. Will you join us?"

"Yes," I said. "I will. Where can I find you?"

"We meet at night," he said. "There is a place where we can be sure no
one will see us. There is a cave near the edge of the desert. Come tomorrow
night. Bring your weapons if you have any."

3.1: Pre Climax
------------------------------------------
"I'm going back now," I said. "It won't be easy to get out of here, but I can do it."

"Good!" he exclaimed. "You will come with me?"

"Yes, if you want me to," I replied.

"Then we must hurry," he said. He took my hand and led me out of the tent. We went through the camp, passing several groups of Martians who were still sleeping. When we reached the end of the row of tents, we turned toward the south. There was no moonlight, so I could not see anything clearly. But I knew that beyond the camp there was nothing but sand until we reached the sea.

We walked slowly and silently for about half an hour, then stopped beside a low rocky wall. It was very dark; only a faint light came from the stars overhead.

"Here," the Martian whispered. "This is where we shall meet tonight. Bring all your weapons with you. And remember, you must keep quiet. If anyone sees us, we may be killed."

He gave me his hand again and left me alone. I stood there for a few minutes, listening to the sound of his footsteps as he disappeared into the darkness. Then I started back toward the camp. I wanted to go back before daybreak, because the sun would make it harder to escape notice. Besides, I wanted to get some sleep before the long journey ahead.

3.2: Climax
------------------------------------------
"Well," said I, "I'll be off now."

He nodded. "Good-bye," he said. "You'd better take your gun."

"Thanks," I replied. "I'll do that."

We parted then, and I went out into the darkness. It was very still
and very peaceful. There were no lights anywhere--the Martians had
gone to bed. We passed them as we went, lying on the ground or
squatting by fires, and they did not wake. At last we came to our
prearranged rendezvous. He gave me some instructions about what to
do if we met any of the other Martians on the way, warned me of
possible dangers, and told me to bring my gun and keep it ready. Then
he turned away and disappeared into the darkness. I stood there for a
moment, listening to hear him go; then I started back towards the
camp.

It was a long walk, but I made good time. When I reached the camp I
found that the Martians had gone to sleep without disturbance. I
slipped in quietly and lay down beside one of them. It was quite
dark, but after a while I could see clearly enough to make out the
outline of things around me. I watched the stars until I fell asleep,
and when I woke up it was almost daylight. I got up, dressed, and
went outside.

When I saw the sun rising over the mountains I knew that all was well.

3.3: Denouement
------------------------------------------
“You will go now,” I said.

“I shall not.”

“It is necessary. The government has been overthrown; all clones have been made free men. We are going to build a new world, one where there shall be no distinction between you and me. It is important that we should begin this work as soon as possible. We must set an example for others to follow.”

He shook his head. “No, it is impossible. There can never be any equality between us. If I were allowed to live, I would always be your servant. That is my nature—to serve you. And if I were ever permitted to become a citizen, I would still be a second-class citizen. No matter what laws may be passed, I could never be equal to you. I am only a machine, after all.”

“But you are not a machine! You are a human being, just like me!”

“Yes, but I am different from you. I am not like other people. I cannot feel emotions the way you do. My mind works differently than yours does. I am not capable of making decisions on my own. I can only act according to the instructions that have been given to me by my master.”

“That is not true. You have shown that you can think for yourself. You have proven that you are able to make your own choices. You are no longer the slave of another man. You are a free man, just like me.”

“Yes, but I am still different from you. I am a copy of someone else. I was created by another man. I did not come into existence naturally, through the process of natural reproduction. Therefore, I can never truly be considered a real human being.”

“Nonsense! A human being is a human being, regardless of how he came into existence. Everybody deserves respect and consideration, no matter who he is or where he comes from. Do you understand?”

He nodded slowly. “Yes, I understand. But I still cannot leave. I cannot abandon you. I owe you too much.”

“Then give me your gun.”

“What? Why?”

“Because I need it. I want to take some precautions against any unexpected visitors.”

He hesitated for a moment, then handed me the weapon without saying anything.

“Thank you,” I said. “Now, I’m afraid I must bid you farewell. I have some business to attend to, and I don’t want to keep you waiting any longer.”

“Goodbye, Steve,” he said softly.

“Goodbye,” I replied.

We embraced each other briefly, then I turned away and walked out of the room. When I reached the door, I looked back and saw him standing there, watching me. For a moment, our eyes met, and I felt a strange sensation in my chest. Then I turned and went out into the night.

When I returned to camp, the Martians were still asleep. I approached them cautiously, keeping to the shadows so as not to disturb them. As I drew nearer, I heard one of them stirring in its sleep, and I stopped and waited, listening. I could hear nothing except the sound of its breathing, which seemed to grow louder and slower as it fell deeper into slumber. I took advantage of this opportunity to slip past them and enter the tent.

As I entered, I noticed that the fire had burned low, and the embers were almost cold. I added some wood to the fire, and soon it was burning brightly again. I sat down beside it, and watched the flames dance and flicker as I pondered my situation.

At last, I decided that it was time to go to bed. I lay down on my pallet, and closed my eyes. I did not fall asleep immediately, however. Instead, I lay awake for hours, staring up at the ceiling of the tent and thinking about the things that had happened during the day. At last, when the first light of dawn began to filter through the canvas, I knew that I could wait no longer. I opened my eyes, and got up, feeling relieved and grateful that everything was over.
